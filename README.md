- Hi, I’m Zach Zeisler.

- I'm a third-year PhD Candidate in Neuroscience at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai.

- I’m interested in applying modern data science techniques to neuroscience research. 

- My work focuses on understanding how the structure of prefrontal cortex interacts with the rest of the brain to drive cognition.

- You can learn more about my work on my personal website [zachzeisler.com](zachzeisler.com "My personal website") or I'm on Twitter [@ZachZeisler1](twitter.com/zachzeisler1 "Follow me on Twitter").
